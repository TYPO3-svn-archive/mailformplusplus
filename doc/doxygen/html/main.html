The swiss army knife for all kinds of mailforms, completely new written using the MVC concept. Result: Flexibility, Flexibility, Flexibility. MailformPlus MVC is a total redesign of the getting-old MailformPlus (aka th_mailformplus). MailformPlus MVC has now a new core, new architecture, new features.<p>
Beside the reach set of features provided by MailformPlus MVC, you may like the flexibility in the sense of possible different configuration. Projects have all their own specificities. One customer want this component while the other one want to have this other one. I think it is very challenging to come up with an extension that is features reach without overloading the code basis.<p>
MailformPlus MVC solves the problem by having a very modular approach. The extension is piloted mainly by some nice TypoScript where is is possible to define exactly what to implement. You may want to play with some interceptor, finisher, logger, validators etc... For more information, you should have a look into the folder "Examples" of the extension which refers many interesting samples.<p>
When installing the extension, you will notice it has a dependency to "gimmefive". MailformPlus MVC definitely looks into the future as it integrate some bricks from the branch v5 of TYPO3. For the moment, "gimmefive" is a transition framework for us. Our plans is to upgrade our code to use "ExtBase" eventually when this one will be enough stable.<p>
